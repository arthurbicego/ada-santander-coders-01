Note: You will only need to save the product data in a file.

- Create product containing the information product name, quantity and price.
- Edit product, which takes the new information and updates the product chosen by the identifier. (To do this list the products with an identifier being the position of the product).
- Exclude product, which takes the position of the product and deletes it. (For this, list the products with an identifier being the position of the product)
- Product search. Get the name or part of it, filter all products that contain the name and show the filtered list.
- Purchase of products, where the user can choose products and quantities as he wants, as soon as he chooses to finalize, show everything he bought, the prices and the total. When he chooses the product and quantity, check if the product has that quantity, if not, inform the user that it does not contain the quantity of this product in stock. Once the user confirms the purchase, deduct the quantities of the selected products.
- An exit option that closes the program if the user chooses to.
